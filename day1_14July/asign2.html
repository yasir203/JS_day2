<!-- Write the difference between var, let and const with code examples -->
<!-- var and let are both used for variable declaration in javascript but the difference between them is that var is function scoped and let is block scoped.
It can be said that a variable declared with var is defined throughout the program as compared to let.
An example will clarify the difference even better

CONST
ES2015 (ES6) introduced const keyword to define a new variable. The difference in const variable declaration than others is that it cannot be reassigned.

Properties:

Cannot be reassigned.
Block Scope
It can be assign on the variable on declaration line.
Primitive value.
The property of a const object can be change but it cannot be change to reference to the new object
The values inside the const array can be change, it can add new items to const arrays but it cannot reference to a new array.
Re-declaring of a const variable inside different block scope is allowed.
Cannot be Hoisted.
Create only read only reference to value.
